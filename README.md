Usage instructions
------------------
1. Go to Netflix and log in.
1. Navigate to the `Your Account` page via the profile menu at the top-right.
1. In the `MY PROFILE` section, follow the `Ratings` link.
1. At the top of your ratings page find the start/stop buttons and the script's output area.
1. Click the start button.
1. When the script finishes, you can copy the data in the output area to a new text file or to somewhere else for further processing (e.g. a spreadsheet). The first row has the column titles. Columns are tab-separated.

A Netflix movie URL can be reconstructed like so: `https://www.netflix.com/title/<netflix_id>`


Known issues
------------
* If you have the streaming plan, this script will work "as is". If you have the DVD plan, try loading https://dvd.netflix.com/MoviesYouveSeen and scroll to the end of the page. If it loads more movies, great, you can use this script "as is". If it does not, try [v1.18 of this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m5n/netflix-ratings-extractor/10e33f0063aee2b26f03c12ea3acf5dc2d94b3fe/netflix-ratings-extractor.user.js).
* Extracting the ratings from the page can be slow if you have a lot of rated movies. Extracting 2500 ratings can take more than 60 seconds.

Acknowledgments
---------------
This script is based on [Anthony Lieuallen's "getFlix Revamped"](http://web.arantius.com/getflix-revamped), which is based on [Devanshu Mehta's "getFlix" scripts](http://www.scienceaddiction.com/2006/03/03/fetch-your-netflix-ratings/), which in turn are based on [scripts by John Resig](http://ejohn.org/projects/netflix). I completely rewrote Anthony's script for version 1.0 of my script, but I learned the Greasemonkey ropes by studying his script.

Needless to say I'm standing on the shoulders of giants.
